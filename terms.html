        <p>
            The General Terms and Service Specific Terms are collectively referred
            to as the “Terms”. In the event of a conflict between the General Terms
            and Service Specific Terms, the Service Specific Terms shall prevail.
        </p>

        <div class="care">
            <div class="h8">Acceptance of the Terms</div>
            <p>
                You must be of legal age to enter into a binding agreement in order to
                accept the Terms. If you do not agree to the General Terms, do not use

            </p>

            <div class="h8">Subscription to Beta Service</div>
            <p>
                We may offer certain Services as closed or open beta services ("Beta
                Service" or “Beta Services”) for the purpose of testing and
                evaluation. You agree that we have the sole authority and discretion
                to determine the period of time for testing and evaluation of Beta
                Services. We will be the sole judge of the success of such testing and
                the decision, if any, to offer the Beta Services as commercial
                services. You will be under no obligation to acquire a subscription to
                use any paid Service as a result of your subscription to any Beta
                Service. We reserve the right to fully or partially discontinue, at
                any time and from time to time, temporarily or permanently, any of the
                Beta Services with or without notice to you. You agree that Neu Ocean
                will not be liable to you or to any third party for any harm related
                to, arising out of, or caused by the modification, suspension or
                discontinuance of any of the Beta Services for any reason.
            </p>

            <div class="h8">Modification of Terms of Service</div>
            <p>
                We may modify the Terms upon notice to you at any time through a
                service announcement or by sending email to your primary email
                address. If we make significant changes to the Terms that affect your
                rights, you will be provided with at least 30 days advance notice of
                the changes by email to your primary email address. You may terminate
                your use of the Services by providing Neu Ocean notice by email within
                30 days of being notified of the availability of the modified Terms if
                the Terms are modified in a manner that substantially affects your
                rights in connection with use of the Services. In the event of such
                termination, you will be entitled to prorated refund of the unused
                portion of any prepaid fees. Your continued use of the Service after
                the effective date of any change to the Terms will be deemed to be
                your agreement to the modified Terms.
            </p>

            <div class="h8">User Sign up Obligations</div>
            <p>
                You need to sign up for a user account by providing all required
                information in order to access or use the Services. If you represent
                an organization and wish to use the Services for corporate internal
                use, we recommend that you, and all other users from your
                organization, sign up for user accounts by providing your corporate
                contact information. In particular, we recommend that you use your
                corporate email address. You agree to:
            </p>
            <p>
                - provide true, accurate, current and complete information about
                yourself as prompted by the sign up process; and
            </p>
            <p>
                - maintain and promptly update the information provided during sign up
                to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, outdated,
                or incomplete, or if Neu Ocean has reasonable grounds to suspect that
                such information is untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, Neu
                Ocean may terminate your user account and refuse current or future use
                of any or all of the Services.
            </p>

            <div class="h8">Organization Accounts and Administrators</div>
            <p>
                When you sign up for an account for your organization you may specify
                one or more administrators. The administrators will have the right to
                configure the Services based on your requirements and manage end users
                in your organization account. If your organization account is created
                and configured on your behalf by a third party, it is likely that such
                third party has assumed administrator role for your organization. Make
                sure that you enter into a suitable agreement with such third party
                specifying such party’s roles and restrictions as an administrator of
                your organization account.
            </p>
            <p>You are responsible for:</p>
            <p>- ensuring confidentiality of your organization account password</p>
            <p>
                - appointing competent individuals as administrators for managing your
                organization account, and
            </p>
            <p>
                - ensuring that all activities that occur in connection with your
                organization account comply with this Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
                You understand that Neu Ocean is not responsible for account
                administration and internal management of the Services for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are responsible for taking necessary steps for ensuring that your
                organization does not lose control of the administrator accounts. You
                may specify a process to be followed for recovering control in the
                event of such loss of control of the administrator accounts by sending
                an email to support@neuocean.com, provided that the process is
                acceptable to Neu Ocean
            </p>
            <p>
                In the absence of any specified administrator account recovery
                process, Neu Ocean may provide control of an administrator account to
                an individual providing proof satisfactory to Neu Ocean demonstrating
                authorization to act on behalf of the organization. You agree not to
                hold Neu Ocean liable for the consequences of any action taken by Neu
                Ocean in good faith in this regard.
            </p>

            <div class="h8">Personal Information and Privacy</div>
            <p>
                Personal information you provide to Neu Ocean through the Service is
                governed by the Neu Ocean Privacy Policy. Your election to use the
                Service indicates your acceptance of the terms of the Neu Ocean
                Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are responsible for maintaining confidentiality of your username,
                password and other sensitive information. You are responsible for all
                activities that occur in your user account and you agree to inform us
                immediately of any unauthorized use of your user account by email to
                support@neuocean.com.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are not responsible for any loss or damage to you or to any third
                party incurred as a result of any unauthorized access and/or use of
                your user account, or otherwise.
            </p>

            <div class="h8">Communications from Neu Ocean</div>
            <p>
                The Service may include certain communications from Neu Ocean, such as
                service announcements, administrative messages and newsletters. You
                understand that these communications shall be considered part of using
                the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of our policy to provide you total privacy, we also provide
                you the option of opting out from receiving newsletters from us.
                However, you will not be able to opt-out from receiving service
                announcements and administrative messages.
            </p>

            <div class="h8">Complaints</div>
            <p>
                If we receive a complaint from any person against you with respect to
                your activities as part of use of the Services, we will forward the
                complaint to the primary email address of your user account. You must
                respond to the complainant directly within 10 days of receiving the
                complaint forwarded by us and copy Neu Ocean in the communication. If
                you do not respond to the complainant within 10 days from the date of
                our email to you, we may disclose your name and contact information to
                the complainant for enabling the complainant to take legal action
                against you. You understand that your failure to respond to the
                forwarded complaint within the 10 days’ time limit will be construed
                as your consent to disclosure of your name and contact information by
                Neu Ocean to the complainant.
            </p>

            <div class="h8">Fees and Payments</div>
            <p>
                The Services are available under subscription plans of various
                durations. Payments for subscription plans of duration of less than a
                year can be made only by Credit Card. Your subscription will be
                automatically renewed at the end of each subscription period unless
                you downgrade your paid subscription plan to a free plan or inform us
                that you do not wish to renew the subscription. At the time of
                automatic renewal, the subscription fee will be charged to the Credit
                Card last used by you. We provide you the option of changing the
                details if you would like the payment for the renewal to be made
                through a different Credit Card. If you do not wish to renew the
                subscription, you must inform us at least seven days prior to the
                renewal date. If you have not downgraded to a free plan and if you
                have not informed us that you do not wish to renew the subscription,
                you will be presumed to have authorized Neu Ocean to charge the
                subscription fee to the Credit Card last used by you.
            </p>
            <p>
                From time to time, we may change the price of any Service or charge
                for use of Services that are currently available free of charge. Any
                increase in charges will not apply until the expiry of your then
                current billing cycle. You will not be charged for using any Service
                unless you have opted for a paid subscription plan.
            </p>

            <div class="h8">Restrictions on Use</div>

                the Services for any illegal or unauthorized activity.
            </p>

            <div class="h8">Inactive User Accounts Policy</div>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to terminate unpaid user accounts that are
                inactive for a continuous period of 120 days. In the event of such
                termination, all data associated with such user account will be
                deleted. We will provide you prior notice of such termination and
                option to back-up your data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data deletion policy may be implemented with respect to any or all
                of the Services. Each Service will be considered an independent and
                separate service for the purpose of calculating the period of
                inactivity. In other words, activity in one of the Services is not
                sufficient to keep your user account in another Service active. In
                case of accounts with more than one user, if at least one of the users
                is active, the account will not be considered inactive.
            </p>

            <div class="h8">Data Ownership</div>

                Further, by making any content available in the manner aforementioned,
                you expressly agree that Neu Ocean will have the right to block access

                rights in such content. By using any of the Services and transmitting
                or publishing any content using such Service, you expressly consent to
